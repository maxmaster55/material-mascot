 * Measured ear geometry, produced by tools/trace_ears.py from the reference
 * art — the same approach as the body silhouettes: measure the shape once and
 * ship the numbers, rather than hand-tuning bezier control points.
 *
 * The reference draws the pair sitting on a head that is not itself drawn.
 * Fitting a circle to the two base curves recovers it to 0.6% (rms 1.5px on
 * R=242), which is what makes this representation possible: the ears are not a
 * separate shape placed near a body, they are a RADIAL PROFILE of the same
 * head — for each angle off the crown, how far the silhouette stands out, in
 * head radii. Rebuilding that as max(head, ear) reproduces the traced art to
 * IoU 0.991.
 *
 * MaterialBot unions this into the live body profile, so the ears cannot come
 * off (there is only ever one outline) and a smooth union makes the join flow
 * instead of creasing.
